# boardcola (in progress)

A collaboration board created with the Play Framework and PostgresDB as the back-end and AngularJS for the front-end.

###### Build instructions

Within public/, run the command **npm install** to install nodejs packages and then run **bower install** to install bower components that are javascript dependencies.

You will also need to set up a PostgresDB and point your application.conf (message me if you need an example) to it.

After that, you should be able to start the app by running **activator run**.
